# Task Reminder

## Description:
API serves as the backend for a task management application. It allows users to create, update, assign, and manage tasks efficiently. The API also includes user authentication functionality to ensure secure access to the system.

---

## Functional Requirements:
1. **User Authentication:**
   - Users should be able to register, log in, and manage their accounts securely.
  
2. **Task Management:**
   - Users can create, update, delete tasks.
   - Tasks can be assigned to specific users.
   - Tasks should have deadlines and priorities.
   - Users can mark tasks as completed.

3. **API Endpoints:**
   - `/api/tasks/`: Endpoint to manage tasks.
   - `/api/users/`: Endpoint for user management.
  
4. **Data Validation:**
   - Input data should be validated to ensure consistency and integrity.

5. **Error Handling:**
   - Proper error messages and status codes should be returned for invalid requests.

## Non-Functional Requirements:
1. **Security:**
   - Implement secure user authentication mechanisms.
   - Protect sensitive data and endpoints from unauthorized access.

2. **Performance:**
   - Ensure efficient database queries and response times.
   - Optimize API responses for speed and scalability.

3. **Documentation:**
   - Provide clear and comprehensive API documentation for developers to understand endpoints and payloads.

4. **Testing:**
   - Conduct thorough testing of API endpoints, including unit tests and integration tests.
  
5. **Scalability:**
   - Design the API to be scalable to handle increased traffic and data volume.
